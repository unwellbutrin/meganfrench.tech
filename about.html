  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Megan French, a student of Computer Science with a divine fascination for biology, data, logical algebra, and the mysteries that connect them all. My journey began with a curiosity for how information flows, but, not just through machines, but through bodies, genes, generations, and ancient texts.</p>
    <p>I believe the intersection of **science and spirit** is where real transformation lies. This belief has led me to a path that blends code with compassion, analytics with ancestral wisdom, and algorithms with awe.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>Timeline of Goals</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2025 – Started CS Associates Program</h3>
        <p>Enrolled in my first formal computer science courses at University of the People, discovering Python and the art of logical problem-solving. Set to graduate by 2027.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2027 – Start CS Bachelors Program </h3>
        <p> I will enroll at UoPeople again to earn my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. I should have this completed by 2029. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2029 - Enroll in NYU Tandon School of Engineering - M.S in Biomedical Engineering </h3>
        <p>I would LOVE to get accepted into this program and will be working myself to the bone to do anything I can to make tuition easier on myself. I plan to apply to scholarships and save as much money as I can during undergrad to make this happen for myself.  </p>
     <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2031 - Enroll in UC Berkeley's Bioengineering Program - PhD in Computational Biology </h3>
        <p>My dream chool. My end goal. The ultimate reason for it all. Projected time is about 5 years.  </p>
 <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2032 - Enroll in CERN's Doctorate Student Residency Research Programme </h3>
        <p> CERN has a program for doctorate students that allows you to do a residency abroad in Geneva as part of the learning program. It would be an absolute dream come true to work alongside some of the most brilliant minds on the planet. </p>
 <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2037 - Work for BAE Systems, DARPA, or CERN itself </h3>
        <p> If you cant beat em, join em. </p>
       
      </div>
    </div>

  <div class="manifesto-scroll">
    I walk with faith, but code with reason. I seek patterns in cells and in stars. My science is sacred. My research is a ritual. My goal: to bridge the biological, spiritual, and the digital for the good of humanity. 
  </div>

  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>I find strength in women like <strong>Gladys West</strong>, whose work on GPS reminds us that quiet persistence can literally shape the entire world. I also draw deeply from spiritual texts and sacred traditions that remind me: knowledge is nothing without wisdom, and progress is nothing without purpose.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fun-facts">
    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I use 'nerd' as a sacred title, not a perjorative.</li>
      <li>I believe science fiction is often prophecy.</li>
      <li>I study ancient languages in my free time (Greek, Hebrew, Latin).</li>
      <li>My two maternal great-grandmothers are both still alive at 92!</li>
    </ul>
